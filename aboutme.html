			<p>Hello! My name is Nakayla Renee Smith and I attend <a href="northeastern.edu" target="_blank"> Northeastern University</a> in Boston, MA as a Computer Engineering major, on track to graduate in 2019. I received the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/aai/programs/ujima-global-leaders-program/" target="_blank"> Ujima Global Leaders Scholarship</a> and I work on campus in the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/smilelab/ourteam" target="_blank"> Synergistic Media Learning Lab </a> as an undergraduate researcher, helping with the Computer Vision project.</p>

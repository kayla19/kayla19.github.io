		<h3 style="text-align:center;">C++ and MATLAB Data Project</h3>
		<p>This project involved me intaking a large 20x40 array of data from a .txt file in C++, then sorting every other number into a separate array using nested for loops. The result was 2 20x20 arrays. I output the results to 2 .txt files, then imported the data into MATLAB. From there, I determined the maximum values, minimum values, and average for both arrays and plotted them into a 3 dimensional mesh graph. This entire project can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/klv4pqp7w8q596j/AAAdeEYGBBFVyl3JxQPG32Wma?dl=0" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

		<h3 style="text-align:center;">Mini Smarthome Project</h3>
		<p>Video <a href="https://youtu.be/vH6hyp7OHrE" target="_blank"> here.</a> This project involved incorporating a number of peripheral devices including light and temperature sensors, an LCD, a piezospeaker, a switch, and a servo on a breadboard. The device was hooked up to an Arduino Uno and controlled throught the IDE. It was coded in C. You can find the source code for it <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5lzlx8vmbtcqsdn/SmartHomeProject.cpp?dl=0" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

		<h3 style="text-align:center;">Sumo Battle Robot</h3>
		<p>This project involved building a robot on a breadboard with an ATMega microcontroller. The breadboard and microcontroller were strapped to an aluminum chassis with 4 wheels, each controlled by a 360 servo and all powered with a battery pack. In addition, there were 3 sensors for the front and floor on each side of the robot. Once the code was uploaded to the mocrocontroller, the robot was self sufficient. The project included wiring the robots, assigning each peripheral to a port on the microcontroller, calibrating the wheels so they turned at the exact same speed, and coding it all on C in the Arduino terminal. Afterwards, the robots were pitted against one another and was written about on the school website <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/news/2014/10/sumo-robots-do-battle/" target="_blank"> here.</a> You can find the code for it <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8381acnq7n6c2wu/basic_sumo_simple.cpp?dl=0" target="_blank"> here. </a></p>

		<h3 style="text-align:center;">Super TV Guide - YHack Fall 2014</h3>
		<p>This web app was hacked in 36 hours by a team of 3 at YHack 2014. This was my first hackathon, and therefore my role was not very large in this, but I gained valuable exposure to Javascript.</p>

		<h3 style="text-align:center;">Wthr - Hack Princeton Fall 2014</h3>
		<p>This web app was built in 36 hours at Hack Princeton using Python, a bootstrap site, and the openweathermap API. In this project, I got to try my hand at design and designed the logo and chose the app colors. My role also included the bootstrap integration.</p>

		<h3 style="text-align:center;">Personal Website</h3>
		<p>I coded this website myself. I used <a href="http://jnicol.github.io/particleground/" target="_blank"> Particle Ground</a> by Jonathan Nicol for the background of the index page. All other code is my own, and entirely self taught. The repository for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/kayla19/kayla19.github.io" target="_blank"> here</a></p>
